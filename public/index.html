          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
          <p>Quincy For Transformative Change is a grassroots organization that formed in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests in summer 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. The primary focus of the group is to organize, promote, and facilitate collaborative and strategic antiracist actions and initiatives that seek to break down structures of oppression and discrimination.</p>

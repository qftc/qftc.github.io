  'Quincy For Transformative Change is a grassroots organization that formed in the wake of a series of Black Lives Matter protests in summer 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. The initial protest, "Quincy Candlelight Vigil to Stand in Support of Black Lives" on June 2nd in downtown Quincy, drew over 4500 attendees from all over Massachusetts. We seek to empower the residents of Quincy to take action in our community, advocate for marginalized folks, and break down structures of oppression and discrimination with collaborative antiracist actions and initiatives.'

    Our Mission
  statement:
    “Bring together people in the Quincy area to end systemic injustice.”
  details:
    As an anti-racist organization, we believe that all human beings are inherently worthy, and deserve to have the same agency and opportunities free from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class, disability, religion, age, immigration status, or physical appearance. We value diversity, and we seek to transform Quincy by addressing and eliminating unjust policies and practices that stand in the way of fair treatment and opportunity for all. Our primary goals are to educate/inform, advocate, and take action in solidarity with Black lives to create and maintain a more inclusive Quincy.

    position: Quincy For Transformative Change
    content: The mission of Quincy For Transformative Change is to bring together people in the Quincy area to end systemic injustice. While we are just one city, we are also part of a larger movement. As an anti-racist organization, we believe that all human beings are inherently worthy, and deserve to have the same agency and opportunities free from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class, disability, religion, age, immigration status, or physical appearance. We value diversity, and we seek to transform Quincy by addressing and eliminating unjust policies and practices that stand in the way of fair treatment and opportunity for all. Our primary goals are to educate/inform, advocate, and take action in solidarity with Black lives to create and maintain a more inclusive Quincy.

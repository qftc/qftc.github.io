  title: Who we are
  content: '<p class="lead"> Quincy For Transformative Change is a grassroots organization
    that formed in the wake of a series of Black Lives Matter protests in summer 2020
    after the murder of George Floyd. The initial protest, "Quincy Candlelight Vigil
    to Stand in Support of Black Lives" on June 2nd in downtown Quincy, drew over
    4500 attendees from all over Massachusetts. We seek to empower the residents of
    Quincy to take action in our community, advocate for marginalized folks, and break
    down structures of oppression and discrimination with collaborative antiracist
    actions and initiatives. </p> <p class="lead"> Our mission statement: "The mission
    of Quincy For Transformative Change is to bring together people in the Quincy
    area to end systemic injustice. While we are just one city, we are also part of
    a larger movement. As an anti-racist organization, we believe that all human beings
    are inherently worthy, and deserve to have the same agency and opportunities free
    from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic
    class, disability, religion, age, immigration status, or physical appearance.
    We value diversity, and we seek to transform Quincy by addressing and eliminating
    unjust policies and practices that stand in the way of fair treatment and opportunity
    for all. Our primary goals are to educate/inform, advocate, and take action in
    solidarity with Black lives to create and maintain a more inclusive Quincy." </p>'

    content: Cold calling can be a great way to generate quality leads. You get to
      speak to the gatekeepers and stakeholders, and you get a great insight into
      their requirements and influences. But cold calling is an art-form. It can be
      daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression.
